        "The Bag-of-Words (BOW) representation is another pretty intuitive way to represent any given text. We simply throw away the order of the words in the text and, instead, we just represent the text as the set of words contained in it. For example, \"I love Machine Learning\" becomes the unordered set [\"I\", \"love\", \"Machine\", \"Learning\"]. This gives us a way to compare between different documents as well, because we can just check how similar their corresponding sets of words are! Like with the previous two methods, the BOW model does not capture everything about the text, but it does a pretty good job.

We can compute $P(Y)$ to be the distribution of class labels in the training set, We then compute $P(X|Y)$ for each $X,Y$ pair. In our case, we compute the probability of finding a word $X$ in a message of class $Y$ for each class and word in our dictionary. Finally, we assume that $P(X)$ comes from some nice distribution (usually a uniform distribution because we assume that the probability of getting any particular input is the same). \n",

        "This gives us 3 computable steps to develop a classifier we can use to compute the probability of getting each $Y$ for a given $X$ so we can find the most probable class. You may notice that the equations I listed above were for computing the probability of $Y$ given one $X$, but in reality we will be computing the conditional probability of $Y$ given many known random variables $X$. We can do these computations using basic probability laws -- but we are forced to make the assumption that each of our $Xs$ are conditionally independent from one another, which is rarely actually true. \n",

This gives us less accurate probability measures $P(X|Y)$ and can increase the dimensionality of our data greatly - opening up the possibiilty of overfitting\n",

Our best possible model (with unigram and bigram features, using a complement equation for calculating probabilities) drasically outperformed our simple length-based features. \n",
